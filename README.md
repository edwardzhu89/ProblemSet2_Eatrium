# Eatrium App Server

This project aims to alleviate crowding in the Eatrium and 7th Floor Cafe at CIS by allowing students to pre-order food. The server, written in Java and using the ACM graphics library, processes requests from the Eatrium App. Offloading heavy computations to a server ensures the mobile app runs efficiently, providing real-time updates on available food items and reducing queue times. Android Studio is used to develop the app, enabling easy distribution through the Google Play Store. Java's object-oriented capabilities support a modular design, facilitating network connectivity and robust software development.

Students have long faced issues with crowding during snack and lunch times. By implementing a dedicated pre-ordering service, this project addresses the need for a quick and efficient system that minimizes waiting times and improves the overall dining experience. The server processes data and sends it to the Eatrium App, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.
